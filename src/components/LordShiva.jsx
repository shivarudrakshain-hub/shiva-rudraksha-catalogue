        <p>Lord Shiva is a principal deity in Hinduism and holds a central place in many Hindu traditions. He is often described as the transformer within the commonly presented Hindu triad of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, while Shaiva traditions worship Shiva as the Supreme Reality itself.</p>
        <p>Shiva embodies seemingly contrasting qualities: stillness and cosmic movement, renunciation and family life, dissolution and renewal. His imagery is rich with symbols that point toward meditation, self-knowledge, impermanence and spiritual liberation.</p>
